The reason for this project is to test the capabilities of the raspberry pi and its ability to render 3d objects

An overview of the project:
Create a virtual reality haptic feedback glove that can:
1. Render 3d objects using only a Raspberry pi 2
2. Create a glove with 10 vibrating motors to give sensation of touch from virtual objects

The whole program is contained in glove.py
at the top I wrote the instructions on how to set everything up the way we did for this to work
